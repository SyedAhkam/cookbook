# In Python 2 use `raw_input` instead

# Basic string input
string = input()

# Typecast to integer
integer = int(input()) 

# Input function accepts a string to prompt before taking input
name = input("What is your name?")

# Use a '\n' (newline char) to recieve input from next line
age = input("How old are you?\n")

# Add any character after '\n' to print it just before the prompt
singer = input("Who is your favorite singer?\n>> ")

# Use C-c to exit a prompt
